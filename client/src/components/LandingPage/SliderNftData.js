    description:
      "This is America was painted in 2020 with spray paints on a piece of cardboard. I created the sign on May 30th to bring to the protests in Chicago after George Floyd's life was taken. A photo of the protest was later pictured on Obama's website https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1267534340503846912?s=20. 70 limited edition NFTs were minted and sent for free to anyone that liked and shared my twitter posts about the protest and how to give back. This Artwork was created to honor the lives of Eric Garner, Michelle Cusseaux, Tanisha Anderson, Tamir Rice, Natasha McKenna, Walter Scott, Bettie Jones, Philando Castile, Botham Jean, Atatiana Jefferson, Eric Reason, Dominique Clayton, Breona Taylor, George Floyd, and so many other black people that were senselessly murdered by police officers. If you decide to sell this NFT, please consider donating a portion of the proceeds to George Floyd Memorial Fund https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd or organizations like NAACP that are fighting to ensure a society in which all individuals have equal rights without discrimination based on race.",
